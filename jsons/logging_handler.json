                    "solution": "For improved testability and isolation, a potential enhancement would be to avoid configuring the root logger directly. Instead, the `LoggingHandler` could create and configure a specific, named logger (e.g., `logging.getLogger('mqi_communicator')`) and have all application code retrieve children of this logger. This would prevent interference with logging from third-party libraries.",
                    "benefit": "Increases the isolation of the application's logging, making it more predictable and easier to control during tests (e.g., redirecting logs to a buffer for assertions without affecting other loggers)."
